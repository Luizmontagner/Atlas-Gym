### **Design Choices**

As soon as I decided the gym's name I built the logo using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") and decided that I would be using dark colors. I have used [Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/ "Color Hex") to find appropriate colors that would match with the internal spaces of the gym.

#### Fonts

Since I used a [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") font called "Colo Pro" in my hero image and the header logo image, I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") and found a font called "Anton" that subtly fit the rest of the site. In the text of the cards, I used the font "Roboto" which the own [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") suggested as a good combination to use with the "Anton" font. 

<a></a>
#### Icons

I have used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") to implement the icons to social media area. I have styled the icons according the website colors.

#### Colors

I based my color scheme on the internal spaces of the gym as matts, walls and equipments.
You can view my color scheme [here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/272408).

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. I also used my own codes on the website structure.

## Wireframes

I have decided to use Balsamic to create wireframes for my website. First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. For my website I have decided to go for a 3 pages website which suits more with the current trends. The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar.

You can find my wireframes below:

## Features

### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation

For the navbar I have used flex box to create a responsive navbar.

#### Hero Image

I have decided to implement a hero image which spreads over 100% width of the screen. In order to make the user curious about what follows next, I decided to set the height at 70vh so show a little peek of what comes next. I also added a 1px solid black border to highlight the image.
The image responds well when viewing on desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### Home Page


#### Gallery Page

#### Join Page

## Features to be implemented

- Proper Hamburger button
- Configure form submission
-

## **Testing**

### Navigation bar

* **Plan**    

I want a navigation bar which will have only the logo and three menus to make it clear and easy to the user. Whenever clicked on one of the navigation links, it should take you where you want to go.


* **Implementation**   
I implemented the navigation bar using ....  

* **Test**    
To test the navigation bar, I have click all the links to make sure it works properly. 
I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it works on all browsers and devices. 

* **Result**    
The navigation bar shows nicely like expected on all browsers and devices. 
It did notice that the contact link was too close to the right side of the screen which I solved by increasing the margin. 
All the links work properly and the scrollspy gives a clear view on where you are located on the page. 

* **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.


### Contact Form 

* **Plan**

I want to include a contact form which the user can fill in when they want to reach out to the owners directly.
They should insert their name, email address & phone number so the owners can easily get back to them. 
They should also be able include a message with the questions they are having. 
Whenever they submit the form, I want a modal to open up in order to give feedback to the user that the form has been submitted correctly.

* **Implementation** 

In order to implement this, I have created a form in my index.html with 3 input fields, 1 textarea field and a submit button. 
As it is a small & simple form, I have decided to not work with labels but placeholders instead. 
I made sure that the form was styled according to the rest of the website. 

* **Test**  

When I tested the form, I noticed that the modal opened up eventhough the form was not filled in. 
This gave the wrong feedback to the user. As I didn't have the required skills to implement form validation, I discussed this with my mentor. 
My mentor wrote a small part of JavaScript which I was able to implement in order for the form not being able to be submitted without the required fields being filled in. 
The data that is being inserted is currently not send anywhere as I don't have the knowledge yet but this is on the list with future features to be implemented. 

* **Result**  

After implementing the JavaScript, the form worked as planned and provided the correct feedback to the user.

* **Verdict**  

The form met all the criteria and works as planned.

#### Form validation


#### Hero Image

* **Bug**    

The hero image looked nice on normal browsers but the quality on safari on mobile was very bad. 
* **Fix**  

Tried various fixes but none of them seemed to be working. 
After talking to my mentor, we changed the background-attachment to scroll on mobile and this resolved the bug. 
* **Verdict**  

Image now shows nicely on all devices and browsers.
#### Hamburger dropdown menu

* **Bug**   

On mobile devices when you click the hamburger icon, the menu appears nicely. 
Whenever you click on one of the links the dropdown menu doesn't dissapear but stays open. 
This is not a good user experience.

* **Verdict** 

I did various research to have this resolved but at this moment I don't have the required skills yet. 
This would be fixed in futher releases. 

#### Icons

* **Bug**

The social media icons didn't show nicely on mobile. One appeared below the other 2 instead of all 3 next to each other.
* **Fix** 

Reduced the font-size and padding which resolved the issue immediately.
* **Verdict** 

Icons now show nicely next to each other on all devices and browsers.

#### Navigation menu on smaller screensizes 

* **Bug**    

When the screen gets smaller, the fontsize of the navigation bar is too small and the collapse button goes off the screen. 

* **Fix**  

Removed the display: block and updated the width to 100% instead of 100vw like the assessor suggested. 
Updated the font-size as well in order to be more easy to read. 

* **Verdict**    

Bug was resolved and navigation bar now works as planned and is more userfriendly.
