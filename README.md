### **Design Choices**

As soon as I decided the gym's name I built the logo using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") and decided that I would be using dark colors.
 I have used [Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/ "Color Hex") to find appropriate colors that would match with the internal spaces of the gym.

#### Fonts

Since I used a [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") font called "Colo Pro" in my hero image and the header logo image, 
I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") and found a font called "Anton" that subtly fit the rest of the site. 
In the text of the cards, I used the font "Roboto" which the own [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") suggested as a good combination to use with the "Anton" font. 

<a></a>
#### Icons

I have used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") to implement the icons to social media area. I have styled the icons according the website colors. The navigation menu will transform into a hamburger icon to make it more simple to use on mobile.



#### Colors

I based my color scheme on the internal spaces of the gym as matts, walls and equipments.
You can view my color scheme [here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/272408).

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## Wireframes

I have decided to use Balsamic to create wireframes for my website.
For my website I have decided to go for a 1 page website which suits more with the current trends. 
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar or by scrolling down the page.

You can find my wireframes below:

## Features

### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation

For the navbar I have used Boostrap to create a responsive navbar. 
I have implemented as well the hamburger icon for mobile devices to be more user-friendly. 
In order to navigate more easilty through the site, I have implemented to scroll spy option from bootstrap
to let the user exactly know where they are located on the site. For this to work properly I have fixed the navbar on the top of the page.

#### Hero Image

I have decided to implement a hero image which spreads over 100% width of the screen. 
The image responds well when viewing on desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### Gym Classes
For the gmy classes I have used [Bootstrap Classes](https://getbootstrap.com/) in order to make it responsive to all screen resolutions.

#### Gallery Page

For the gallery I have implemented a carousel using bootstrap so this way the gallery will look good on desktop, tablet or mobile.

### Contact

At the contact section I have provided contact and location details on the bottom of the page. 
Below the form there is a submit button which also triggers a modal to open up which gives feedback to the user that the form has been successfully submitted.

## Features to be implemented

- Form Validation
- Terms and Conditions
- Online Enrollment

## **Testing**

### Navigation bar

* **Plan**    

    I want a navigation bar which will have only the logo and five menus to make it clear and easy to the user. Whenever clicked on one of the navigation links, it should take you where you want to go.


* **Implementation**   
I implemented the navigation bar using Bootstrap. This helps to give an overall structure and lay out to the navbar. 
I have used CSS to overwrite the default settings and making the navbar in line with the overall webite. 
I have also used Bootstrap to implement the hamburger sign for mobile devices.

* **Test**    
To test the navigation bar, I have click all the links to make sure it works properly. 
I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it works on all browsers and devices. 

* **Result**    
The navigation bar shows nicely like expected on all browsers and devices. 
It did notice that the contact link was too close to the right side of the screen which I solved by increasing the margin. 
All the links work properly and the scrollspy gives a clear view on where you are located on the page. 

* **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.


### Contact Form 

* **Plan**

    I want to include a contact form which the user can fill in when they want to reach out to the gym directly.
They should insert their name, email address so the gym can easily get back to them. 
They can also be able include a message with the questions they are having. 
Whenever they submit the form, I want a modal to open up in order to give feedback to the user that the form has been submitted correctly.

* **Implementation** 

    In order to implement this, I have created a form in my index.html with 2 input fields, 1 textarea field and a submit button. 
As it is a small & simple form. I made sure that the form was styled according to the rest of the website. 

* **Test**  

    When I tested the form, I noticed that the modal opened up eventhough the form was not filled in. 
This gave the wrong feedback to the user. The data that is being inserted is currently not send anywhere as I don't have the knowledge yet but this is on the list with future features to be implemented. 

* **Result**  

    I still working on that.

* **Verdict**

## Bugs

#### Contact Form

* **Bug**    

    The user is able to submit the form without filling in the fields. Modal always appears. This provides the wrong feedback to the user.

* **Fix**  


* **Verdict**  


#### Icons


* **Bug**  
    The social media icons didn't show nicely on mobile. One appeared below the other 2 instead of all 3 next to each other.

* **Fix**  
    Reduced the font-size and padding which resolved the issue immediately.

* **Verdict** 
    Icons now show nicely next to each other on all devices and browsers.

* **Bug**   

    When you click the hamburger icon, the menu appears nicely. 
    Whenever you click on one of the links the dropdown menu doesn't dissapear but stays open. 
    This is not a good user experience.

* **Verdict** 


#### Contact information

* **Bug**  
    Contact information disappears on small screens

* **Fix**  

    I have added media queries to the contact information.

* **Verdict** 
    The contact information is showing perfectly on all screens.

#### Lighthouse

* **Bug**  
    The website perfomance is bad because of the images.

* **Fix**  
    Fisrt I tried to remove the images from the folder and add direct links but it didn't work.
    Now I replaced the PGN images for JPEG images.

* **Verdict** 
    The perfomance test has improved.

#### Navbar

* **Bug**

    The navbar is superimposing the hero image in mobile screens.

* **Fix**  

    I have added padding-top to the body.

* **Verdict** 

    The hero image is showing perfectly on all devices.

From [Canva](https://canva.com/) I have used all the images for my website. For the hero image I also built it on [Canva](https://canva.com/).

### Acknowledgements

I want to thank mentor Simen for having the patience to teach and advise me during this project. He helped me with tips on topics and showed me solutions to problems in a simple and efficient way. For a student who does not have English as a first language, it can be challenging to teach something complex like coding.

I would also like to thank my wife, for being patient while I was studying at night and for taking care of our baby while I had to study and develop the project.

This was my very fisrt project and I'm glad I could finish it.
