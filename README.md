### **Design Choices**

As soon as I decided the gym's name I built the logo using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") and decided that I would be using dark colors. I have used [Color Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/ "Color Hex") to find appropriate colors that would match with the internal spaces of the gym.

#### Fonts

Since I used a [Canva](https://www.canva.com/ "Canva") font called "Colo Pro" in my hero image and the header logo image, I visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") and found a font called "Anton" that subtly fit the rest of the site. In the text of the cards, I used the font "Roboto" which the own [Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") suggested as a good combination to use with the "Anton" font.

#### Icons

I have used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") to implement the icons to social media area. I have styled the icons according the website colors.

#### Colors

I based my color scheme on the internal spaces of the gym as matts, walls and equipments.
You can view my color scheme [here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/272408).

#### Structure

I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. I also used my own codes on the website structure.

## Wireframes

I have decided to use Balsamic to create wireframes for my website. First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. For my website I have decided to go for a 3 pages website which suits more with the current trends. The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar.

You can find my wireframes below:
